### **Problem Statement**
**Header:** *“Why QA Is Still Broken.”*  
**Content:**  
*“For years, we’ve been told that Agile, DevOps, and CI/CD solved QA’s challenges. Yet testing is still slow, reactive, and disconnected from the software development process. Automated tests execute faster, but they aren’t smarter. Developers still don’t trust results, and quality remains an afterthought.”*
